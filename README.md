#SFU Companion

###Description:
Modularizing resources in SFU into one location with added features of group chat, event organizer, polling and sharing access to social media. This web app is similar to the SFU app in mobile platform. However, the resources in SFU are web-based modules such that this wep app localized all resources into one web app with extra features.

###Modules and Features:
1. **Login Module:** When you first visit the webpage, there’ll be a welcome page giving a short description or slogan of the web app. There will be a log in or sign up button shown with the welcome page, but you can also choose to visit the website as a guest. Some features do not require a user account, such as viewing the map, searching through courses or library, etc. while others do, such as adding friends, sharing to social media, etc.

2. **Shoutouts Module** Registered users will be able to post messages that other users can view and reply to. Shoutouts are a way to convey/enquire relevant information regarding SFU's course works, academic schedules, dates, events and so on. Shoutouts can also be used to have conversations or help find someone to study with etc.

3. **Course Module:** Users will be able to add the classes that they are taking each semester. Using the SFU Course Information API, this will allow users to view course descriptions or outlines, exam date and times, and class schedules organized into a weekly schedule. Information about SFU’s academic programs will also be available to users through the SFU Academic Calendar API. We will also utilize Google Maps API to provide students with their class locations for both the Surrey and Burnaby Campus.

4. **Library Module:** This feature will allow people who visit the web app to get information about the SFU library. Using the SFU library API, users will get info on library hours, book searches, equipment searches, and computer workstation availability searches.

5. **Friends/Groups Module:** People who have a user account will be able to add or remove other users from their friends list. This will allow people to view or share their schedules with each other and send messages to each other. There will also be a group module where you can invite multiple friends to events through an event planner or create polls to make to decisions.

6. **Transit Module:** Users will be able to lookup the bus schedule for SFU burnaby buses and also have information about the road conditions using the SFU Road Report API.

7. **Calendar Module:** Each user will have their own calendars where they can add events or deadlines, such as exam or assignment due dates, and also create reminders

###Problems With Existing System:
Although there are a few mobile apps and websites providing similar services, we found that we can improve in this area. First, some of the mobile apps are only available for certain OSs. This means that some users on android or iOS might not get access to the same resources. We can solve this problem by creating a web application so that anyone can access the information. This will also eliminate the problem of downloading an app. Second, since SFU has many different websites for accessing their resources; this creates the hassle of needing to open up multiple tabs or browsers. Depending on what the student is looking for, they might have to go through several portals or links before getting where they need to be. By combining everything into one location, it will save efforts and times. As well, since SFU has many features spread throughout their multiple web pages, this webapp can provide some useful features that some SFU students might not even know about. An example of this would be that SFU’s map has the ability sort the buildings into its different floor levels. Finally, having a generalized combined SFU webapp, it can provide SFU students with a quicker resolution to organized group work; i.e. group projects, and having trouble on deciding on a form of communication (e.g. does everyone have Facebook or Google Hangouts or Slack to communicate with?). By having most of SFU’s resources in one location, it will make group work easier to share ideas and information.
